# Things you should know:
* To open the menu in-game the **default key** is **"I"** or you can type **"/menu"**
* Your settings will **always** be **stored locally**, so even if you delete the resource it **will** keep your current settings. The **only** way you can wipe the local storage sucessfully is by clicking the **"Reset Settings"** button on the in-game menu
(comes with new open menu sound, close menu sound, click menu sound)
* If you receive ```attempt to index a nil value (global 'Lang')``` in your F8 console, the fastest way you can fix that issue is by downloading a new version via txAdminRecipe but if you are unable to do that because of the progress you’ve made on your existing build; you’ll have to unfortunately go through and download each one from the GitHub which I do not recommend. Save yourself a lot of time and pain by just downloading the recipe!

##
**Q:** What does the purple circle/radial do?

**A:** That is your harness indicator! When you have the item "harness" in your inventory and while in a vehicle it will appear. Also, when you use your item "harness", the circle/radial will reflect the amount of uses left and decrease overtime.
